### About

To have some context, in Chile there is a process of changing the constitution, so the people needs to have meetings to discuss what should be included and how. In government website they allow to upload a manifest file that represents the result of the discussion, and also explain how this discuss should be moderated. The problem is that there is no centralised way to gather the people and make public the details of those discussions, where it is, who is going and most important to record the discussion and broadcast it in real time.
